## Android Application


This is a client-side application that will work with 
a RESTful API created in COMP2001. This application aims to give the opportunity to 
every student to be able to upload their project details to the website. 

In this application every student 
should be able to login to this app with their username and password and to be able 
to see, edit, delete their project details and especially to be able to upload an image 
file that is a thumbnail of their poster. However, the actual application has name 
“Student app” and will give the opportunity to every student to have access to their 
project details. Also, in this application every student will be able to create new project 
details, to check if their project details have been uploaded and if they wish, to update
or to delete their project details. However, in this application the students will not be 
able to upload a photo because that is the only part that is not working with this app.
